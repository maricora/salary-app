Salary calculation app

Done in AngularJS.

Used Angular seed at https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.


Running instructions (nothing special :) )

Must have node.js and npm installed -> http://nodejs.org/

Useful commands:

1.
```
npm install
```
For installing dependencies (also runs 'bower install')

2.
```
npm start
```

The app will now be located at `http://localhost:8000`.

3.
```
npm test
```

For running unit tests.
